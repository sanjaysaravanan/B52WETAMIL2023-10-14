  var --> es5, let, const --> es6,  

  how javascript was named 

  Hoisting: ( meaning going from bottom to top level  )

    Moving the declartions of the variable/function/other types to the top level, 
    i.e, even before starting the execution of the js codes 

    1. var:
        Moves the declartion to the top level with value undefined

    2. let, const ( block scoped variable )
        Let, const cannot be hoisted
        reason --> local/current scope variables

    3. function
        Functions is also will be hoisted with proper function definition


  block scoping:
    using let, const inside local scope instead of var
  
  Copy by Value & Copy by Reference:

    value:
      passing the value for the argument/parameter as a primitive variable( varaible which holds primitive data )

    Reference:
      passing the value for the argument/parameter as a composite variable( varaible which holds composite data )

  types of functions:
    0. Normal Function
    1. Anonymous Function - a function with no name is called as anonymous function
    2. function variable - a function used as a value to a variable
    3. Arrow functions:
      Function whcih uses arrow syntax instead of function keywor
      function keyword vs arrow syntax --> will discuss during OOPS Concept
    4. IIFE --> 
    
  Iteration Concepts:
    for of
    for in
    array forEach

    Array:
      for of
      for in
    
    JSON Iteration:
      for in
      Object.keys(obj): return array of keys
      
      Object.values(obj): return array of values
